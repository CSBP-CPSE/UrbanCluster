# UrbanCluster
A collaborative project to create urban clasters and cluster statistics.

This is a collaborative project between the Data Exploration and Integration Lab (DEIL), the OECD Secretariat (Working Party on Territorial Indicators) and the Data Science Program at the University of British Columbia. The goal is to enhance and expand a Python code used to create urban clusters, with the use of open data on building footprints and other open source tools.
